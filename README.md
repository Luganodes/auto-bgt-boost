# Auto BGT Boost

Take your validator operations to the next level with this fully automated tool. No more manual intervention requiredâ€”this tool optimizes your validator's performance by automatically boosting it at regular intervals based on your set thresholds, a process that can be cumbersome and error-prone when done manually. Using Web3Signer, the tool signs and broadcasts transactions seamlessly, ensuring that boosts are queued and activated after 8191 blocks without any effort on your part. It supports multiple validators simultaneously, making it easy to manage and optimize performance across your entire fleet.
